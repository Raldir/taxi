Our simple yet efficient approach is based on ISA relations extracted with Hearst-style lexico-syntactic patterns from large corpora and substring inclusion. We rely on focused crawling to create custom corpora of each domain. F-measure of the golden standard evaluation of our method achieves up to 0.39 on golden standard evaluation and precision up to 0.90 on the on manual evaluation. Our experiments show that the method performs well across different domains and languages. Only a small manual labour is needed to adapt it to a new domain or language.\r\n\r\n### Taxonomy Induction Method\r\n\r\nOur approach to taxonomy induction consist of four steps. First, we crawl domain-specific corpora based on terminology of the target domain. Second, candidate hypernyms are extracted based on substrings and lexico-syntactic patterns. These candidates are subsequently pruned on a per word basis. The last step performs optimization of the overall taxonomy structure removing cycles and connecting components to the root. Below we present description of each of these steps. \r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nSemEval Task 13: Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation (TExEval-2): http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task13/\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the project write to Alexander Panchenko (email available at http://panchenko.me) or open a Github issue.
